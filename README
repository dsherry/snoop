SNOOP

SYNOPSIS
    Snoop is a musical instrument controlled by listening to network interfaces.

DESCRIPTION
    The project consists of 2 parts:
        o A synth server written in Supercollider speaking OSC over UDP
        o A client that monitors ethernet packets on a network interface and
            which sends OSC messages to the server to control various parameters.

    The idea is that the activity of a network card is forwarded to control the
    synthesizer. Using something like libpcap, we can map different network
    protocol messages to synthesizer sounds. The clients can be written in any
    language that can be used to listen to network activity and send OSC
    messages over UDP.

    The synth will be controlled by some background network activity (like ARP
    requests) but can be excited by user activity:
        o Flushing the OS ARP cache
        o Sending ICMP, DNS, DHCP requests
        o Browsing the internet/sending whatsapp messages (i.e sending TCP requests)

TO BE DEFINED
    o What network packets can we listen on?
        o ARP (entire network)
        o DHCP
        o TCP/UDP
        o DNS
        o ICMP
    o What parameters can we control and how should we map each packet to synth parameters?
